<h1>Electro-Mechanical Pinball Machines</h1>

<p>Electro-Mechanical(EM) Pinball machines were arguably the most successful
  pinball machines ever made. Although they may not have the fancy digital
  augments that modern pinball machines have, they definitely have a certain
  reliable, complex, and satisfying physical presence that other modern Machines
  dont quite match. Their Golden Age has generally been recognized as the
  time just after World War 2, between 1948 and 1958.</p>

<h2>Brief history of how EM pinball machines came about</h2>

<p>The original pinball machines didnt have flippers that could actually be
  activated and origniated in France as a game called Bagatelle. The pinball
  machine that most people think of, which has flippers isn't very close to the
  orignal pinball machine but does share some basic similarities. Pinball even
  has roots as a gambling game where a  plunger was used to hit a steel ball
  bearing, and then the bearing would fall into a hole or other obstacle to
  score points, which could then be redeemed for cash or other prizes.</p>
